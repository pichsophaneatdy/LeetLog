## Why I build LEETLOG

LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding problems, and as users solve more questions, it can become challenging to keep track of their progress. LeetLog aims to simplify this process by providing a user-friendly interface for users to log and review their completed LeetCode questions. With its distribution map feature, users can visualize their progress and identify areas that require improvement.
